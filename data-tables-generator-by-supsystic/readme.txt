**Data Tables Generator by Supsystic**
A powerful table builder plugin for WordPress — with built-in charts and graphs. Think of it like **Excel spreadsheets for WordPress websites**, where your data lives in structured tables and can also be visualised with charts when needed.


Data Tables Generator by Supsystic is a flexible [WordPress table plugin](https://supsystic.com/plugins/wordpress-data-table-plugin/)  that lets you create clean, interactive tables and datatables, with integrated charts and graphs to present structured data clearly — without writing code.

If your content makes more sense in rows and columns — but benefits from visual insights too — this plugin was built for you.

= 📊 Turn Data Into Usable Tables (and Visuals) =
Create:
* Simple and complex data tables
* Comparison and pricing tables
* Lists, schedules, directories, and datasets
* Large tables built from spreadsheet-style data
* [Charts and graphs](https://supsystic.com/blog/how-to-visualize-data-table-information-with/) generated directly from table data

Tables are responsive by default and remain readable on all devices.

= 🧩 A Serious Table Builder — Not Just a Block =
This is a dedicated table builder, designed for real data.
Built for table-heavy content where structure and usability matter:

* Sorting, searching, and pagination
* Column control and visibility options
* Reliable performance with large datatables
* Visual charts to highlight trends and comparisons

You get structured tables and visual storytelling in one plugin.

= 📥 Import From Spreadsheet & Database Sources =
Create tables manually or [import data](https://supsystic.com/importing-data-into-wordpress-tables/) from:
* CSV files
* Excel spreadsheets
* Google Sheets
* MySQL databases

Ideal if your data already lives outside WordPress.

= 🔄 Work With Dynamic Data =
Data Tables Generator supports tables connected to [external data sources](https://supsystic.com/documentation/dynamic-data-tables/). 
When your source data changes — such as a spreadsheet or database — tables can be updated without rebuilding them from scratch. This makes it suitable for data that evolves over time, not just static content.
**For example**:
 If you manage a product list, pricing table, availability sheet, or catalogue in a spreadsheet, you can connect it to a table on your site.
 When prices, descriptions, or other data change in the source file, the table can be updated without manually editing it inside WordPress.

= 🎨 Style Tables to Match Your Site =
[Customise tables and charts](https://supsystic.com/building-pricing-tables-with-wordpress-plugin/) visually:
* Fonts, colours, borders, and spacing
* Row and column formatting
* Links, images, icons, and tooltips
* Optional custom CSS is available for advanced users.

Table cells can also include images and video, allowing you to build richer layouts — such as:
* Product or feature comparison tables with short demo videos
* Staff or team directories with profile media
* Data lists where visuals explain context better than text

= 📘 Learn as You Go =
Data Tables Generator includes a growing library of [step-by-step tutorials](https://supsystic.com/docs/data-tables/).
From your first table to more advanced setups with charts and larger datasets, the guides focus on practical, real-world use cases.

= ⚡ Fast, Stable, and Actively Maintained =
Built to handle real-world data without slowing down your site. The plugin is [regularly updated](https://wordpress.org/plugins/data-tables-generator-by-supsystic/#developers) to stay compatible with the latest versions of WordPress and modern themes.

= ⚙️ Beginner Friendly. Developer Capable. =
* Visual table builder UI
* Insert tables using shortcodes or blocks
* Extend behaviour with custom CSS or JavaScript
Suitable for site owners, agencies, and developers alike.

= 🔓 Free Version + Pro When You Need More Power =
The free version covers most common table use cases [Upgrade to Pro](https://supsystic.com/plugins/wordpress-data-table-plugin/) and is ideal for getting started.

As your data grows or requirements become more advanced, the Pro version unlocks tools designed to save time and reduce manual work, including:

* Formula calculations and computed values
* Advanced filtering and search logic
* Front-end table editing
* Additional import and export options
* Enhanced chart and visualisation features

❓**Frequently Asked Questions**


**How do I create my first table?**
After installing the plugin, go to Data Tables → Add New in your WordPress dashboard.
You can start with a blank table or import data from a spreadsheet. The table editor works much like a spreadsheet, so adding rows, columns, and content should feel familiar.


**How can I edit table data after it’s created?**
You can edit table data at any time from the table editor in the WordPress admin area.
For more advanced workflows, the Pro version also supports front-end table editing, allowing authorised users to update data directly from the site interface.


**Can I style tables to match my site design?**
Yes. Tables can be styled visually to match your theme.
You can control fonts, colours, borders, spacing, and layout options directly in the plugin. Advanced users can also apply custom CSS if needed.


**Can I import data from Excel, CSV, or Google Sheets?**
Yes. Data Tables Generator supports importing data from CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, Google Sheets, and MySQL databases.
This makes it easy to turn existing spreadsheet data into interactive tables on your WordPress site.


**How do I add a table to a page or post?**
Tables can be added to pages or posts using shortcodes or blocks.
Once inserted, the table will automatically reflect any updates made in the table editor.


**Can I add images, links, or media inside tables?**
Yes. Table cells can include images, links, icons, videos, and other HTML elements.
This allows you to create richer tables such as product comparisons, staff directories, or feature lists with visual elements.
